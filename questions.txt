Why are animals like bees so important to the environment, and what would happen if they disappeared?|Bees are incredibly important because they pollinate plants, which means they help plants grow by moving pollen from one flower to another. This process is essential for many fruits, vegetables, and nuts to grow. Without bees, plants wouldnâ€™t be able to produce food as easily, which could lead to shortages for humans and animals. Bees also support entire ecosystems by helping plants that provide shelter and food for other animals. If bees disappeared, it would disrupt the balance of nature and make it harder for people to grow crops, which would affect everyone. Protecting bees means protecting our planet!
